Chess.py - a module to be added to a Jasper program
Last edited: 12 March 2020
Creator: Joe Bruckner

Implements a chess API and supports a Chess engine to play against
a brave human player. Classes include a chessmatch which has a board
and players, chess players, a generic chess piece class which is
inherited by all different types of chess pieces (ie. pawn, rook, etc.).
A chess engine class (in work) inherits chess player and makes any random,
legal move
